    <h2>Our mission</h2>
    <p>We believe in representation, in creating narratives and stories which give people the opportunity to explore who they are.</p>
    <p>We seek to expose and celebrate the wide array of diversity the definition "being attracted to two or more genders" can include, and the intricacy of its intersection with gender, race, nationality, age and sexuality. As a group that has often been erased and excluded from both straight and gay spaces, this is a place to see ourselves and for our identity to be represented, to acknowledge both our privileges and unique struggles.</p>
